# SQL-RockbusterMarketAnalysis
As an analyst for Rockbuster Stealth I am conducting an analysis of historical data to help create a launch strategy for a new online video rental program.

# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Context

Rockbuster Stealth is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. In recent years, competitors started offering streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, pushing Rockbuster to look at what is next for the company to stay competitive with other companies while using its existing movie licenses. The aim of this project was to analyze historical data from Rockbuster Stealth including profits, movie catalog, and customers and where they are located to help the business analyst department create a launch strategy of the upcoming online service. 

## Key Questions

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data 

This project uses data sets that contains information about Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, and payments.
